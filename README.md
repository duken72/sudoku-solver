A C++ Sudoku solver

Sad story, I didn't know about backtracking when I started. If you don't know about it yet, you can check this [link](https://youtu.be/G_UYXzGuqvM).

I tried to avoid using it, but some Sudoku puzzles are so damn hard that you just have to try out all possibilities, with backtracking :)
